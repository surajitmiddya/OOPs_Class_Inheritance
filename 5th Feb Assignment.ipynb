    "* Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the mechanism of hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world, and only exposing the necessary information to the user. This helps in protecting the data and behavior of the object from external interference, and also promotes modularity and code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inheritance: Inheritance allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting all the properties and methods of the parent class, and also adding new properties and methods to the child class. This promotes code reuse, and also enables the creation of a hierarchy of classes, with more specialized classes inheriting from more general ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same class, by using the same interface or method signature. This promotes code flexibility and extensibility, and enables the creation of generic algorithms and data structures that can work with objects of multiple types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of identifying the essential features and behaviors of an object, and representing them in a simplified, abstract form. This helps in managing complexity, and also promotes code clarity and maintainability."
